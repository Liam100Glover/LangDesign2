# Stage 4: Global Variables & Type‐Error Handling Tests
# Verifies assignment to globals, reading them back, and that mixing strings and numbers raises an error.

# 1) Assignment and arithmetic with globals
x = 5
x = x + 10
print x
# Expected output: 15.0

# 2) String concatenation with globals
greeting = "Hello"
greeting = greeting + " world!"
print (greeting)
# Expected output: Hello world!

# 3) Boolean logic on globals
truth = true
print (truth and false)
# Expected output: False

# 4) Mixed‐type error
mixed = "abc"
mixed = mixed + 123
# Expected runtime error: Cannot add str and float

# 5) Multiple concatenations
greeting = "Hi"
name     = "Coding"
message  = greeting + ", " + name
print message
# Expected output: Hi, Coding

# 6) More boolean logic
a = true
b = false
print a and b
# Expected output: False
print a or b
# Expected output: True
